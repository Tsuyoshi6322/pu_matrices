# Uni Project - Matrices
---

## What's that?
### Short answer
(Not so) mandatory uni project - programming classes from my first year (2024-2025).

### Long answer
Write a program that enabled the calculation and display of the following operations on rectangular n x m dimensions - specified by the user and filled with random values in the range 1-100.

The operations to perform:
- Sum of two matrices
- Substraction of two matrices
- Multiplication product of two matrices
- Transposition of a single matrix
- Zeroing the elements on the main diagonal of the matrix
- Arithmetic mean of all values in the matrix
- Geometric mean of all values in the matrix
- Frequency of occurence (a table) of each value in the matrix
- LU decomposition using Doolittle's method

## What's the 'unused' folder for?
Well, as the name suggests, it contains useless files. 
At first, the plan was to write this program in C++. 

After writing the body of the program (basically menus and placeholder functions) I switched to Python to practice this language a little more.

The folder .old_files contains the C++ file and the previous version of the Python file.
